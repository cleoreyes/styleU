        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Often times users have a difficult time identifying songs or selecting a song they wish to play. This can cause users to spend time readjusting playlist or looking up a song to the best of their abilities. This will facilitate these task of users that listen to the Kpop genre.
                </li>
                <li> Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").</li>
                <li> Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In short: let us know what you are interested in, and identify a problem that you think needs solving (and that might be amenable to a technological intervention) while also considering what has come before.
                While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with?
                This description should be 1-2 paragraphs (~150-250 words) in length. Your overview should explain "what" the problem is and "why" it needs addressing (including why any currently existing apps are insufficient). You will need to include references to other resources to help clarify your explanation of this problem.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Our Users</h3>
            <p>
                Our main users will be those that listen and enjoy usic of the Kpop genre. We are looking to minimize their time looking up songs to which they may not have all the information of, generate playlist based off of their preferences, and reduce the need for customizing their current playlist. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! Remember:
                    Remember that "viewing" information or navigating ("going to") to something isn't a feature!
                </li>
                <li>
                     What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
                    If you insist on using an API, confirm that you'll be able to access it from a client-side app by testing it at https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/Links to an external site.. If you can't get data back from this testing site, then it won't work with your project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
                    Remember the app doesn't need to have "business value". But as Informatics students we care about the practical usage and impacts of systems, not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!
