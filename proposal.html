            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Often times users have a difficult time identifying songs or selecting a song they wish to play. This can cause users to spend time readjusting playlist 
                    or looking up a song to the best of their abilities. This will facilitate these task of users that listen to the K-pop genre.</li>
                <li>An information technology problem in the space of the K-Pop genre is that there is no ongoing effort project that serves as a song recommender for the community.
                     K-pop is a large genre of music that encompasses a plethora of music styles and genres from around the world. This makes it difficult for listeners both new and old to
                      find songs and artists that fit their style and preferences. Additionally, the K-pop community includes trading “photocards” of their favorite artists, and identifying 
                      where a photocard comes from is a difficult task for those who are unfamiliar.</li>
                <li>Spotify has several features that offer reccomended songs, but are not catered to the diverse genre of K-pop. With our website, you could get reccomendations not just from 
                    generic preferences, but also from specific members of a group that you like or reccomendations similar to a particular album you enjoy.</li>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Our Users</h3>
            <p>
                Our target audience is mainly anyone who is having trouble with their sense of style and is looking to reduce their consumerism by doing a color and style analysis to help them get a sense of what 
                certain colors, patterns, and styles would compliment them the most while also giving them store recommendations where they can find certain clothing or accessories that matches their given style. 
                If we were to choose a specific group, we would hope that this could also facilitate the process of experimenting with clothing for individuals who struggle with gender identity. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Below are some the possible interactive features we intend to implement
                </li>
                <div class="components">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users will have to log-in, mainly so their results can get saved</li>
                        <li>One main feature is a color analysis quiz, which a process that helps people find the colors that compliment them the most. This will require users to select their skin tone in different lighting.</li>
                        <li>We also will be creating a style “vibe” quiz where users will be asked question relating to their preferred fitting, specific aesthetics they are intrigued by, kinds of clothing they currently feel comfortable in etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <li>

                    The information that we will be using is K-pop data taken from a dataset in kaggle and from an existing database found at <a href="https://dbkpop.com/">dbkpop</a>. 
                    Some data values include the artist/group, album, song, date released, and hopefully other features like lyrics.
                    We intend to import this data from a csv which can be found from dbkpop which was mentioned earlier and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romainfonta2/kpop-song-rankings">kaggle-kpop</a>
            
                </li>
                <li>
                    This application will allow users to make shopping choices ahead of time. There will be minimal need for spending time in clothing stores trying to decipher which garments and colors will suit them the best since our app aims
                     to facilitate the process for them. Additionally, we hope to reduce the amount of consumerism that occurs by giving our users suggestions on where to shop based on their test results
                </li>
            </ol>
