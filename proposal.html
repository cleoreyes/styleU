        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Often times users have a difficult time identifying songs or selecting a song they wish to play. This can cause users to spend time readjusting playlist or looking up a song to the best of their abilities. This will facilitate these task of users that listen to the K-pop genre.
                </li>
                <li>An information technology problem in the space of the K-Pop genre is that there is no ongoing effort project that serves as a song recommender for the community. K-pop is a large genre of music that encompasses a plethora of music styles and genres from around the world. This makes it difficult for listeners both new and old to find songs and artists that fit their style and preferences. Additionally, the K-pop community includes trading “photocards” of their favorite artists, and identifying where a photocard comes from is a difficult task for those who are unfamiliar.
                    .</li>
                <li>Spotify has several features that offer reccomended songs, but are not catered to the diverse genre of K-pop. With our website, you could get reccomendations not just from generic preferences, but also from specific members of a group that you like or reccomendations similar to a particular album you enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In short: let us know what you are interested in, and identify a problem that you think needs solving (and that might be amenable to a technological intervention) while also considering what has come before.
                While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with?
                This description should be 1-2 paragraphs (~150-250 words) in length. Your overview should explain "what" the problem is and "why" it needs addressing (including why any currently existing apps are insufficient). You will need to include references to other resources to help clarify your explanation of this problem.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Our Users</h3>
            <p>
                Our main users will be those that listen and enjoy usic of the K-pop genre. We are looking to minimize their time looking up songs to which they may not have all the information of, generate playlist based off of their preferences, and reduce the need for customizing their current playlist. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Below are some the possible interactive features we intend to implement
                </li>
                <div class="components">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow users to input a K-pop song or artist, and based off those inputs, it generates similar music.</li>
                        <li>Login feature using Google oAuth or account creation with email and password to allow users to save their music session history.</li>
                        <li>Implement EmailJS to allow users to transfer their outputs to a designated email.</li>
                        <li>Natural language comprehension using OpenAI’s whisper and process that through ChatGPT to create functional commands to navigate through the frontend UI or either find songs based off matched lyrics.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <li>

                    The information that we will be using is K-pop data taken from a dataset in kaggle and from an existing database found at <a href="https://dbkpop.com/">dbkpop</a>. 
                    Some data values include the artist/group, album, song, date released, and hopefully other features like lyrics.
                    We intend to import this data from a csv which can be found from dbkpop which was mentioned earlier and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romainfonta2/kpop-song-rankings">kaggle-kpop</a>
            
                </li>

                <li>
                    How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
                    Remember the app doesn't need to have "business value". But as Informatics students we care about the practical usage and impacts of systems, not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!
                </li>
                <li>
                    The app's ability to generate playlists based on user preferences helps in curating personalized music experiences. Users can specify their favorite artists, albums, or even individual group members to receive recommendations tailored to their tastes. 
                    Users often struggle to identify Kpop songs or select ones they want to play due to the vast and diverse nature of the genre. By allowing users to input a song or artist, the app generates similar music recommendations, thus streamlining the song selection process. This saves users time and effort in manually searching for songs, enhancing their overall music listening experience.
