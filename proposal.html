        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The rise of mass consumerism and fashion experimentation leads to overproduction and waste in the fashion industry, which harms the environment. Brands make more clothes than needed to meet demand, using up resources and causing pollution. This results in a lot of discarded clothing, especially with fast fashion, adding to global waste. It also often involves exploiting workers, particularly in developing countries. To tackle these issues, consumers can choose more sustainable habits, and the industry needs to adopt transparent and responsible practices to reduce the environmental and social impact of mass consumerism in fashion.</li>
                <li>In the space of fashion and style, information is scattered on a plethora of different resources which makes it difficult to assess what is best for each individual and keep track. Additionally, making an available version for all to access would be beneficial as these quizzes and consultations are usually a service that is only provided in specific countries. Importantly, addressing the topic of mass consumerism and waste in the fashion industry is something that is pushed to the side, and through this project we would be able to put it in the forefront of individuals and educate them, 
                </li>
                <li>One existing attempt to address fashion style is a website called “Fashmate” which allows users to create their own outfits and styles and share them with the community. While this solution may be useful, it doesn’t address mass consumerism and waste which is a prevalent issue in today’s society.

                Our target audience is mainly anyone who is having trouble with their sense of style and is looking to reduce their consumerism by doing a color and style analysis to help them get a sense of what 
                certain colors, patterns, and styles would compliment them the most while also giving them store recommendations where they can find certain clothing or accessories that matches their given style. 
                If we were to choose a specific group, we would hope that this could also facilitate the process of experimenting with clothing for individuals who struggle with gender identity.

                        <li>We also will be creating a style “vibe” quiz where users will be asked question relating to their preferred fitting, specific aesthetics they are intrigued by, kinds of clothing they currently feel comfortable in etc.</li>

                    The information that we will be using is "Fashion" data taken from a dataset from an existing database found at <a href="https://fashionpedia.github.io/home/">fashionpedia</a>. 
                    Datasets includes a total of 48,825 clothing images, with exhaustive segmentation for clothing items, and fine-grained attributes for the segmented categories. We intend to import this data from a CSV which can be found from this webpage <a href="https://fashionpedia.github.io/home/Fashionpedia_download.html">dataset</a>. A similar platform that we found was <a href="https://styledna.ai/">styledna</a>, which is an ai-powered personal stylist that makes recommendations based on the user's choices.

                    This application will allow users to make shopping choices ahead of time. There will be minimal need for spending time in clothing stores trying to decipher which garments and colors will suit them the best since our app aims
                     to facilitate the process for them. Additionally, we hope to reduce the amount of consumerism that occurs by giving our users suggestions on where to shop based on their test results
=======
                    Users can access a wealth of information about fashion items, including detailed characteristics. This information can empower users to make more informed choices about their clothing purchases, including selecting items that align with their style preferences while also considering factors such as material sustainability and ethical production practices.
                    
                    The app's color analysis and style vibe quizzes serve as interactive features that engage users in understanding their personal style preferences and how to make sustainable fashion choices. By guiding users through these quizzes, the app can help individuals discover clothing options that not only suit their tastes but also contribute to reducing waste and environmental impact. Additionally, by providing store recommendations based on users' style preferences, the app can promote brands and retailers that prioritize sustainability and ethical practices, further encouraging conscious consumerism.
